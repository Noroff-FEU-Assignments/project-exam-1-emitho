Sovereign Horizon is the developer's personal brand. This blog site showcases his web design preferences and flavors well.


## Description

This blog site works by fetching content from a headless content management system. It showcases previews automatically throughout the website based on certain parameters in the content that gets added to a Wordpress admin panel:

- Carousel Element on Home Page fetches all blog posts (image + title) in chronological order and showcases four clickable post previews elegantly. Using the arrows on either side of the track reveals the next/previous four posts.

- Blog Page showcases a Latest Post Element on top, formatted as a large hero image. Hovering over the element darkens the image and activates an overlay which brings a 20 word post excerpt into view over the image. Underneath the Latest Post Element is the Blog Posts Grid which lists and previews every blog post (except for the latest post). Hovering over these blog post grid cards works in the same way as the Latest Post Element; revealing a text excerpt. 

- The site will fetch all categories for all posts in Wordpess and automatically create or remove Category Buttons which can be found 1. in the Category Row between the Latest Post Element and Blog Posts Grid on the Blog Page, and 2. on each Blog Specific Page. Clicking on a Category Button will bring you to a filtered Blog Page view based on the Category Button that was clicked. When filtering by category, the Latest Blog Post will be included in the results but will be skipped when 'All Categories' is active (which it is by default).
